# Project 3 CS 428
> _This has been tested on version 2019.4.28f1 of the Unity software and VRTK 4_

## Introduction and Description

My project takes my Project 2 scene and recreates it in multiple ways. There is a “Mego Playset” scene that takes the building and makes it a playset that can be played with, a “Land of the Giants” scene that makes the user small and places them on top of a cubicle table, a “Dancing on the Ceiling” scene that makes the whole building rotate clockwise or counter clockwise depending on the button you press, and a “Zero Gravity” scene that has all the interactables have no gravity. All of these scenes are linked together through a menu that is tracked on the left controller so it can be easily accessible to the player.

## Github page

This is the Github page for my project. The version of Unity used was Unity 2019.4.28f1 and the version of VRTK used was VRTK 4. To run the application and the code on an Oculus, download the zip file from the Github page, and unzip it. Open up the project in Unity and plug in the VR headset to the PC. The build settings are set to the right settings except for the run device setting. Select the VR headset in the run device setting and build and run. It will take some time, but once it is done building, the application will be on the device. 

## Assets/Sources used

All of the assets from Project 2 are still there. These are the new ones used:

## Discussion:

 The first thing I did was make a menu system to switch between scenes. I remembered seeing a menu for a VR game that was tracked on the bottom of a VR controller and thought it was a nice and user friendly menu that can also be easily implemented. It was changed in the “Dancing on the Ceiling” scene, since there are two buttons that should be pressed to rotate the scene, and it is very convenient to have them on the player at all times in the scene. When I was making the “Mego Playset'' scene, I envisioned a small version of the building where the roofs and the second floor could be removed. This would let the user be able to place the figures/models more easily and conveniently into the building. The second room should also have been interactable with a model, so it’s roof and inside were all interactable. For the “Land of the Giants” scene, I thought it would be easiest to change the building size from it’s initial size and repositioned the camera. Everything would be kept the same pretty much, except for the starting area. A cubicle office would be a good setting to see smaller models and different interactions with them, and it would be on theme to have a ruler or something long be the climbable object in the scene. For the “Dancing on the Ceiling” scene, I just planned on having two buttons on the main wall that rotates the world in either direction, but it was easier and more practical to put them on the menu. For the “Zero Gravity” scene, everything should be interactable and have no gravity to it. I planned on having the triggers on the VR controller drag the world when pressed and moved but I couldn’t implement it, so there is only teleportation still sadly. I took out the object spawners in the “Mego Playset” and “Zero Gravity” scenes.
 
 For the “Mego Playset” scene, I can see it being useful for a new toy exhibit/demo. Like for a lego playset, it could be a cheap alternative to buying a $700 set or something like that. For the “Land of the Giants” scene, I can see it being used for a game where a level changes the world around the player or maybe there is an interaction with an item in the game that changes the size of the player, and also changes the weights and interactions with certain items. For the “Dancing on the Ceiling” scene, I can see it being used for art in a 3D world. A rotation could actually bring a whole new perspective to a world, like looking at a painting from a different angle. For the “Zero Gravity” scene, it can be useful for a space or underwater simulation/game, since both of those don’t require gravity. I can see the menu being the most easily usable in other applications since a button doesn’t need to be pressed and it is always on you, making it convenient for the user.
